# PlotFont

Crude fonts suitable for plotting.

There are many good looking fonts which optimize for appearance. I wanted
some cruder fonts which had a simpler representation: a relatively small
number of straight lines which could easily be plotted by a machine, or
perhaps a person.

# Licenses

The code written by me is licensed under the GPL, version 2 or later.

The data for the fonts come from Jim Studt's canvastext.js
http://jim.studt.net/canvastext/ which he placed in the public
domain. He cites the original source as the Hershey fonts:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts

The Hershey fonts appear to have this license:

1. The following acknowledgements must be distributed with
   the font data:

      - The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr.
        A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S.
        National Bureau of Standards.

     - The format of the Font data in this distribution
        was originally created by
          James Hurt
          Cognition, Inc.
          900 Technology Park Drive
          Billerica, MA 01821
          (mit-eddie!ci-dandelion!hurt)

2. The font data in this distribution may be converted into
   any other format *EXCEPT* the format distributed by
   the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights
   to the distribution and use of the font data in that
   particular format). Not that anybody would really
   *want* to use their format... each point is described
   in eight bytes as "xxx yyy:", where xxx and yyy are
   the coordinate values as ASCII numbers.

It is not clear to me if Mr Studt used 'this distribution'.
